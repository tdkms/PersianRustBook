<p><em>Ownership</em> is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory.
All programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while running.
Some languages have garbage collection that regularly looks for no-longer-used
memory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly
allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed
through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. If
any of the rules are violated, the program won’t compile. None of the features
of ownership will slow down your program while it’s running.</p>
<p>Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time
to get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become with Rust
and the rules of the ownership system, the easier you’ll find it to naturally
develop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!</p>
<p>When you understand ownership, you’ll have a solid foundation for understanding
the features that make Rust unique. In this chapter, you’ll learn ownership by
working through some examples that focus on a very common data structure:
strings.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="the-stack-and-the-heap"><a class="header" href="#the-stack-and-the-heap">The Stack and the Heap</a></h3>
<p>Many programming languages don’t require you to think about the stack and the
heap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a
value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why
you have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will be described in
relation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so here is a brief
explanation in preparation.</p>
<p>Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use
at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores
values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite
order. This is referred to as <em>last in, first out</em>. Think of a stack of
plates: when you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when
you need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from
the middle or bottom wouldn’t work as well! Adding data is called <em>pushing
onto the stack</em>, and removing data is called <em>popping off the stack</em>. All
data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown
size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap
instead.</p>
<p>The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a
certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap
that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a <em>pointer</em>, which
is the address of that location. This process is called <em>allocating on the
heap</em> and is sometimes abbreviated as just <em>allocating</em> (pushing values onto
the stack is not considered allocating). Because the pointer to the heap is a
known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want
the actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being seated at a
restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and
the host finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If
someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve been seated to
find you.</p>
<p>Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the
allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is
always at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap
requires more work because the allocator must first find a big enough space
to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next
allocation.</p>
<p>Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because
you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster
if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server
at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get
all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an
order from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and
then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a
processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other
data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the
heap).</p>
<p>When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function
(including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s
local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those
values get popped off the stack.</p>
<p>Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap,
minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused
data on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership
addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think about the
stack and the heap very often, but knowing that the main purpose of ownership
is to manage heap data can help explain why it works the way it does.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ownership-rules"><a class="header" href="#ownership-rules">Ownership Rules</a></h3>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we
work through the examples that illustrate them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each value in Rust has an <em>owner</em>.</li>
<li>There can only be one owner at a time.</li>
<li>When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="variable-scope"><a class="header" href="#variable-scope">Variable Scope</a></h3>
<p>Now that we’re past basic Rust syntax, we won’t include all the <code>fn main() {</code>
code in examples, so if you’re following along, make sure to put the following
examples inside a <code>main</code> function manually. As a result, our examples will be a
bit more concise, letting us focus on the actual details rather than
boilerplate code.</p>
<p>As a first example of ownership, we’ll look at the <em>scope</em> of some variables. A
scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Take the
following variable:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = "hello";
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The variable <code>s</code> refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is
hardcoded into the text of our program. The variable is valid from the point at
which it’s declared until the end of the current <em>scope</em>. Listing 4-1 shows a
program with comments annotating where the variable <code>s</code> would be valid.</p>
<Listing number="4-1" caption="A variable and the scope in which it is valid">
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    {                      // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
        let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
</Listing>
<p>In other words, there are two important points in time here:</p>
<ul>
<li>When <code>s</code> comes <em>into</em> scope, it is valid.</li>
<li>It remains valid until it goes <em>out of</em> scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are valid is
similar to that in other programming languages. Now we’ll build on top of this
understanding by introducing the <code>String</code> type.</p>
<h3 id="the-string-type"><a class="header" href="#the-string-type">The <code>String</code> Type</a></h3>
<p>To illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more complex
than those we covered in the <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types">“Data Types”</a><!-- ignore --> section
of Chapter 3. The types covered previously are of a known size, can be stored
on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over, and can be
quickly and trivially copied to make a new, independent instance if another
part of code needs to use the same value in a different scope. But we want to
look at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to
clean up that data, and the <code>String</code> type is a great example.</p>
<p>We’ll concentrate on the parts of <code>String</code> that relate to ownership. These
aspects also apply to other complex data types, whether they are provided by
the standard library or created by you. We’ll discuss <code>String</code> in more depth in
<a href="ch08-02-strings.html">Chapter 8</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our
program. String literals are convenient, but they aren’t suitable for every
situation in which we may want to use text. One reason is that they’re
immutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write
our code: for example, what if we want to take user input and store it? For
these situations, Rust has a second string type, <code>String</code>. This type manages
data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that
is unknown to us at compile time. You can create a <code>String</code> from a string
literal using the <code>from</code> function, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = String::from("hello");
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The double colon <code>::</code> operator allows us to namespace this particular <code>from</code>
function under the <code>String</code> type rather than using some sort of name like
<code>string_from</code>. We’ll discuss this syntax more in the <a href="ch05-03-method-syntax.html#method-syntax">“Method
Syntax”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 5, and when we talk
about namespacing with modules in <a href="ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html">“Paths for Referring to an Item in the
Module Tree”</a><!-- ignore --> in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>This kind of string <em>can</em> be mutated:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

    println!("{s}"); // This will print `hello, world!`
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>So, what’s the difference here? Why can <code>String</code> be mutated but literals
cannot? The difference is in how these two types deal with memory.</p>
<h3 id="memory-and-allocation"><a class="header" href="#memory-and-allocation">Memory and Allocation</a></h3>
<p>In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the
text is hardcoded directly into the final executable. This is why string
literals are fast and efficient. But these properties only come from the string
literal’s immutability. Unfortunately, we can’t put a blob of memory into the
binary for each piece of text whose size is unknown at compile time and whose
size might change while running the program.</p>
<p>With the <code>String</code> type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text,
we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time,
to hold the contents. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.</li>
<li>We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we’re done with
our <code>String</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That first part is done by us: when we call <code>String::from</code>, its implementation
requests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming
languages.</p>
<p>However, the second part is different. In languages with a <em>garbage collector
(GC)</em>, the GC keeps track of and cleans up memory that isn’t being used
anymore, and we don’t need to think about it. In most languages without a GC,
it’s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and to
call code to explicitly free it, just as we did to request it. Doing this
correctly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget,
we’ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we’ll have an invalid variable. If
we do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one <code>allocate</code> with
exactly one <code>free</code>.</p>
<p>Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the
variable that owns it goes out of scope. Here’s a version of our scope example
from Listing 4-1 using a <code>String</code> instead of a string literal:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    {
        let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
                                       // longer valid
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our <code>String</code> needs
to the allocator: when <code>s</code> goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of
scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called
<a href="../std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop"><code>drop</code></a><!-- ignore -->, and it’s where the author of <code>String</code> can put
the code to return the memory. Rust calls <code>drop</code> automatically at the closing
curly bracket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item’s
lifetime is sometimes called <em>Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)</em>.
The <code>drop</code> function in Rust will be familiar to you if you’ve used RAII
patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written. It may seem
simple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more
complicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data
we’ve allocated on the heap. Let’s explore some of those situations now.</p>
<!-- Old heading. Do not remove or links may break. -->
<p><a id="ways-variables-and-data-interact-move"></a></p>
<h4 id="variables-and-data-interacting-with-move"><a class="header" href="#variables-and-data-interacting-with-move">Variables and Data Interacting with Move</a></h4>
<p>Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.
Let’s look at an example using an integer in Listing 4-2.</p>
<Listing number="4-2" caption="Assigning the integer value of variable `x` to `y`">
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let x = 5;
    let y = x;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
</Listing>
<p>We can probably guess what this is doing: “bind the value <code>5</code> to <code>x</code>; then make
a copy of the value in <code>x</code> and bind it to <code>y</code>.” We now have two variables, <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code>, and both equal <code>5</code>. This is indeed what is happening, because integers
are simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two <code>5</code> values are pushed
onto the stack.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the <code>String</code> version:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This looks very similar, so we might assume that the way it works would be the
same: that is, the second line would make a copy of the value in <code>s1</code> and bind
it to <code>s2</code>. But this isn’t quite what happens.</p>
<p>Take a look at Figure 4-1 to see what is happening to <code>String</code> under the
covers. A <code>String</code> is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to
the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity.
This group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the
heap that holds the contents.</p>
<p><img alt="Two tables: the first table contains the representation of s1 on the
stack, consisting of its length (5), capacity (5), and a pointer to the first
value in the second table. The second table contains the representation of the
string data on the heap, byte by byte." src="img/trpl04-01.svg" class="center"
style="width: 50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-1: Representation in memory of a <code>String</code>
holding the value <code>"hello"</code> bound to <code>s1</code></span></p>
<p>The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the <code>String</code> are
currently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the
<code>String</code> has received from the allocator. The difference between length and
capacity matters, but not in this context, so for now, it’s fine to ignore the
capacity.</p>
<p>When we assign <code>s1</code> to <code>s2</code>, the <code>String</code> data is copied, meaning we copy the
pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the
data on the heap that the pointer refers to. In other words, the data
representation in memory looks like Figure 4-2.</p>
<p><img alt="Three tables: tables s1 and s2 representing those strings on the
stack, respectively, and both pointing to the same string data on the heap."
src="img/trpl04-02.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-2: Representation in memory of the variable <code>s2</code>
that has a copy of the pointer, length, and capacity of <code>s1</code></span></p>
<p>The representation does <em>not</em> look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory would
look like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the
operation <code>s2 = s1</code> could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if
the data on the heap were large.</p>
<p><img alt="Four tables: two tables representing the stack data for s1 and s2,
and each points to its own copy of string data on the heap."
src="img/trpl04-03.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-3: Another possibility for what <code>s2 = s1</code> might
do if Rust copied the heap data as well</span></p>
<p>Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically
calls the <code>drop</code> function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. But
Figure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a
problem: when <code>s2</code> and <code>s1</code> go out of scope, they will both try to free the
same memory. This is known as a <em>double free</em> error and is one of the memory
safety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory
corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>To ensure memory safety, after the line <code>let s2 = s1;</code>, Rust considers <code>s1</code> as
no longer valid. Therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free anything when <code>s1</code> goes
out of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use <code>s1</code> after <code>s2</code> is
created; it won’t work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;

    println!("{s1}, world!");
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>You’ll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the
invalidated reference:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

</code></pre>
<p>If you’ve heard the terms <em>shallow copy</em> and <em>deep copy</em> while working with
other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity
without copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. But
because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being called a
shallow copy, it’s known as a <em>move</em>. In this example, we would say that <code>s1</code>
was <em>moved</em> into <code>s2</code>. So, what actually happens is shown in Figure 4-4.</p>
<p><img alt="Three tables: tables s1 and s2 representing those strings on the
stack, respectively, and both pointing to the same string data on the heap.
Table s1 is grayed out be-cause s1 is no longer valid; only s2 can be used to

50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-4: Representation in memory after <code>s1</code> has been
invalidated</span></p>
<p>That solves our problem! With only <code>s2</code> valid, when it goes out of scope it
alone will free the memory, and we’re done.</p>
<p>In addition, there’s a design choice that’s implied by this: Rust will never
automatically create “deep” copies of your data. Therefore, any <em>automatic</em>
copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.</p>
<h4 id="scope-and-assignment"><a class="header" href="#scope-and-assignment">Scope and Assignment</a></h4>
<p>The inverse of this is true for the relationship between scoping, ownership, and
memory being freed via the <code>drop</code> function as well. When you assign a completely
new value to an existing variable, Rust will call <code>drop</code> and free the original
value’s memory immediately. Consider this code, for example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    s = String::from("ahoy");

    println!("{s}, world!");
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We initially declare a variable <code>s</code> and bind it to a <code>String</code> with the value
<code>"hello"</code>. Then we immediately create a new <code>String</code> with the value <code>"ahoy"</code> and
assign it to <code>s</code>. At this point, nothing is referring to the original value on
the heap at all.</p>
<p><img alt="One table s representing the string value on the stack, pointing to
the second piece of string data (ahoy) on the heap, with the original string
data (hello) grayed out because it cannot be accessed anymore."
src="img/trpl04-05.svg"
class="center"
style="width: 50%;"
/></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-5: Representation in memory after the initial
value has been replaced in its entirety.</span></p>
<p>The original string thus immediately goes out of scope. Rust will run the <code>drop</code>
function on it and its memory will be freed right away. When we print the value
at the end, it will be <code>"ahoy, world!"</code>.</p>

<h4 id="variables-and-data-interacting-with-clone"><a class="header" href="#variables-and-data-interacting-with-clone">Variables and Data Interacting with Clone</a></h4>
<p>If we <em>do</em> want to deeply copy the heap data of the <code>String</code>, not just the
stack data, we can use a common method called <code>clone</code>. We’ll discuss method
syntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many
programming languages, you’ve probably seen them before.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the <code>clone</code> method in action:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!("s1 = {s1}, s2 = {s2}");
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 4-3,
where the heap data <em>does</em> get copied.</p>
<p>When you see a call to <code>clone</code>, you know that some arbitrary code is being
executed and that code may be expensive. It’s a visual indicator that something
different is going on.</p>
<h4 id="stack-only-data-copy"><a class="header" href="#stack-only-data-copy">Stack-Only Data: Copy</a></h4>
<p>There’s another wrinkle we haven’t talked about yet. This code using
integers—part of which was shown in Listing 4-2—works and is valid:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let x = 5;
    let y = x;

    println!("x = {x}, y = {y}");
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don’t have a call to
<code>clone</code>, but <code>x</code> is still valid and wasn’t moved into <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile
time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick
to make. That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent <code>x</code> from being
valid after we create the variable <code>y</code>. In other words, there’s no difference
between deep and shallow copying here, so calling <code>clone</code> wouldn’t do anything
different from the usual shallow copying, and we can leave it out.</p>
<p>Rust has a special annotation called the <code>Copy</code> trait that we can place on
types that are stored on the stack, as integers are (we’ll talk more about
traits in <a href="ch10-02-traits.html">Chapter 10</a><!-- ignore -->). If a type implements the <code>Copy</code>
trait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied,
making them still valid after assignment to another variable.</p>
<p>Rust won’t let us annotate a type with <code>Copy</code> if the type, or any of its parts,
has implemented the <code>Drop</code> trait. If the type needs something special to happen
when the value goes out of scope and we add the <code>Copy</code> annotation to that type,
we’ll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the <code>Copy</code> annotation
to your type to implement the trait, see <a href="appendix-03-derivable-traits.html">“Derivable
Traits”</a><!-- ignore --> in Appendix C.</p>
<p>So, what types implement the <code>Copy</code> trait? You can check the documentation for
the given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar
values can implement <code>Copy</code>, and nothing that requires allocation or is some
form of resource can implement <code>Copy</code>. Here are some of the types that
implement <code>Copy</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the integer types, such as <code>u32</code>.</li>
<li>The Boolean type, <code>bool</code>, with values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>All the floating-point types, such as <code>f64</code>.</li>
<li>The character type, <code>char</code>.</li>
<li>Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement <code>Copy</code>. For example,
<code>(i32, i32)</code> implements <code>Copy</code>, but <code>(i32, String)</code> does not.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ownership-and-functions"><a class="header" href="#ownership-and-functions">Ownership and Functions</a></h3>
<p>The mechanics of passing a value to a function are similar to those when
assigning a value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or
copy, just as assignment does. Listing 4-3 has an example with some annotations
showing where variables go into and out of scope.</p>
<Listing number="4-3" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Functions with ownership and scope annotated">
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021">fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // because i32 implements the Copy trait,
                                    // x does NOT move into the function,
    println!("{}", x);              // so it's okay to use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{some_string}");
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{some_integer}");
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.</code></pre></pre>
</Listing>
<p>If we tried to use <code>s</code> after the call to <code>takes_ownership</code>, Rust would throw a
compile-time error. These static checks protect us from mistakes. Try adding
code to <code>main</code> that uses <code>s</code> and <code>x</code> to see where you can use them and where
the ownership rules prevent you from doing so.</p>
<h3 id="return-values-and-scope"><a class="header" href="#return-values-and-scope">Return Values and Scope</a></h3>
<p>Returning values can also transfer ownership. Listing 4-4 shows an example of a
function that returns some value, with similar annotations as those in Listing
4-3.</p>
<Listing number="4-4" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Transferring ownership of return values">
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021">fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}</code></pre></pre>
</Listing>
<p>The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a
value to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data on the
heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by <code>drop</code> unless ownership
of the data has been moved to another variable.</p>
<p>While this works, taking ownership and then returning ownership with every
function is a bit tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but
not take ownership? It’s quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to
be passed back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting
from the body of the function that we might want to return as well.</p>
<p>Rust does let us return multiple values using a tuple, as shown in Listing 4-5.</p>
<Listing number="4-5" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Returning ownership of parameters">
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021">fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{s2}' is {len}.");
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -&gt; (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}</code></pre></pre>
</Listing>
<p>But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be
common. Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for using a value without
transferring ownership, called <em>references</em>.</p>
